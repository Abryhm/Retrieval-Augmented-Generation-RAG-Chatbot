The case was filed five years after a complaint lodged by NetSol Technologies Limited with Federal Investigation Authority pertaining to use of NetSol\u2019s IP without authority by a company formed by the employee and his partner who was also an ex-employee of the Company. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of evidence of the plaintiff and the laws applicable, it can safely be inferred that, on merits, no case for damages is made out. This is also endorsed by the fact that the case is barred by the laws relating to limitation. Moreover none of the ingredients forming basis for allowing a case of malicious prosecution are attracted. In the opinion of the legal advisor, the outcome of the case is expected in favour of the Company, hence, no provision is incorporated in these financial statements."
